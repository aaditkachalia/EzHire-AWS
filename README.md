This repository is the official implementation of Interview system using "Continuous Question Answering Framework".

This project is developed & deployed on React (Frontend) and Flask (Backend) along with using Firebase as our database server. 
A small video demo of the chatbot implementation is given [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LsjA-ms-dmtf-1z8v82haUX1A8_rYT-h/view?usp=sharing)

## Backend  (Flask)
